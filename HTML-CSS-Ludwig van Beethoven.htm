<h2>Ludwig van Beethoven</h2>

<p><b>Ludwig van Beethoven</b>(17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827)
was a German composer and pianist.</p>

<p class="opp">Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of Western
music; his works rank amongst the most performed of the classical music repertoire
and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era in
classical music.</p>

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;" class="opp"> His career has conventionally been
divided into early,middle,and late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is
typically considered to have lasted until 1802. </p>

<p style="color:red;"class="opp">Beethoven was born in Bonn. His musical talent was obvious
at an early age. He was initially harshly and intensively.</p>

<p class="opp">His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered
to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed
an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart,and is sometimes characterized as heroic.</p>

<p class="opp">Despite his hearing deteriorating during this period, he continued
to conduct,premiering his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively.
His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806. His last piano concerto (No. 5, Op. 73,
known as the Emperor), dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf of Austria,
was premiered in 1811, without Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf
by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public.
He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two
letters, his Heiligenstadt Testament (1802) to his brothers and his unsent
love letter to an unknown "Immortal Beloved" (1812).</p>

<p class="opp">After 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of
his most admired works, including later symphonies, mature chamber music and
the late piano sonatas. His only opera, Fidelio, first performed in 1805, was
revised to its final version in 1814. He composed Missa solemnis between 1819
and 1823 and his final Symphony, No. 9, one of the first examples of a choral
symphony, between 1822 and 1824. Written in his last years, his late string
quartets, including the Grosse Fuge, of 1825–1826 are among his final achievements.
After some months of bedridden illness, he died in 1827. Beethoven's works remain
mainstays of the classical music repertoire.</p>
